## üö® CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES

### **Student Booking & Invoice Creation Workflow**
This is a **MANDATORY BUSINESS RULE** that must be preserved in all future development.

**üìã Essential Workflow:**
1. When a student booking is created, invoices are **AUTOMATICALLY** generated
2. **Deposit Invoice:** ¬£99 (fixed amount)
3. **Main Invoice:** Total booking amount
4. **Mini Invoices:** One per installment (if installment plan selected)
5. **Progress Tracking:** Real-time calculation based on payments

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL:** This automatic invoice creation process must **NEVER** be broken or removed.

**üìñ Full Documentation:** See `STUDENT_BOOKING_INVOICE_WORKFLOW.md` for complete details.
