# âœ… DASHBOARD FIX APPLIED

## ðŸ”§ **Issue Fixed:**

**Error:** `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`  
**Location:** `DashboardHeader.tsx:102`  
**Cause:** `academicYears` array was undefined on initial render

---

## âœ… **Solution Applied:**

Added safety check to handle `academicYears` being undefined:

```tsx
// Before (caused error):
{academicYears.map((year) => (
  <SelectItem key={year.id} value={year.year_label}>
    {year.year_label}
  </SelectItem>
))}

// After (safe):
{academicYears && academicYears.length > 0 ? (
  academicYears.map((year) => (
    <SelectItem key={year.id} value={year.year_label}>
      {year.year_label}
    </SelectItem>
  ))
) : (
  <SelectItem value="loading" disabled>
    Loading years...
  </SelectItem>
)}
```
